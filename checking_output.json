Ditzel\nBell Laboratories\nComputing Science Research Center\nMurray Hill, New Jersey 07974\nINTRODUCTION\nOne of the primary goals of computer architects is to design computers that are more costeffective\nthan their predecessors. Cost-effectiveness includes the cost of hardware to manufacture\nthe machine, the cost of programming, and costs incurred by the user during the\nmachine\u2019s operational lifetime. In this paper, we argue that Reduced Instruction Set\nComputer (RISC) architectures have the potential to be more cost-effective machines than\nour predecessors.\nDespite drastic improvements in hardware technology, the development of high-level language\nmicroprogramming (HLL/micro) did not yield the expected gains in either performance\nor efficiency. This led to a renewed interest in simplified, or reduced, instruction set\narchitecture. RISC, unlike traditional computer designs, focuses on a small, highly optimized\nset of instructions which places the burden of performance on the software rather than the\nhardware.\nThe paper discusses the principles behind RISC, provides a comparative analysis with\ntraditional architectures, and presents experimental and theoretical evidence supporting\nits advantages. The practical implications are significant for both the design of new systems\nand the optimization of existing software, as RISC designs enable higher performance at lower\ncost by simplifying the hardware and utilizing advanced compiler techniques.\nIn conclusion, the authors propose that future computer architectures should leverage\nRISC principles to achieve superior cost-efficiency and performance.\n",
    "summary": "The text is an advocacy for Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architecture written by David A. Patterson and David R. Ditzel. It argues that RISC designs, which rely on a small yet highly optimized set of instructions, are more cost-effective than traditional architectures. The focus on simplified hardware delegated more performance responsibility to the software. The paper provides comparative analysis, experiments, and theoretical evidence to bolster the assertion that RISC systems are superior in terms of cost-efficiency and performance."
